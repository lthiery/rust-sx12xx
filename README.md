## Cloning, building, testing

You can use cargo to build:
    `cargo build [--release]`

The configuration in `.cargo/config` is configured to build only for the `thumbv6m-none-eabi` platform currently.

The code in the example directory is for the [STM32L0 Discovery kit](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/b-l072z-lrwan1.html), which features the [STM32L072CZ](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32l072cz.html).

To upload the code, start a debug server using either JLink (Note: [you can reprogram the ST-Link](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/other-j-links/st-link-on-board/) on the discovery kit to act like a JLink Server; you will lose the virtual UART over USB provided by the ST-Link):
    `JLinkGDBServer -device STM32L072CZ -speed 4000 -if swd -AutoConnect -1 -port 3333`

or OpenOCD server (Note: if you are using the OpenOCD server, you will want to update `.cargo/config:runner` to use `openocd.gdb` instead of `jlink.gdb`):
    `openocd -f ./openocd.cfg`

run the example:
    `cargo run --example stm32l0x2 [--release]`

Run tests:
    `cargo test --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --tests`
